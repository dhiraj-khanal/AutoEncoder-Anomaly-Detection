# AutoEncoder-Anomaly-Detection
**Introduction**
This project explores the use of machine learning techniques for jet identification and anomaly detection in data produced from the CMS detector at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Using advanced clustering algorithms, we derive essential fields from 4-momentum vectors, train models for classifying jet types, and carry out anomaly detection using autoencoders. This README provides instructions for installing, using, and contributing to this project.
